## A REVIEW OF MEN’S T-SHIRT BY LOVESEWINGMAG



Hi everyone and welcome to my blog! Today I’m going to review the pattern for a men's classic T-shirt from the UK’s favorite sewing magazine @lovesewingmag, which you can download for free at the link below. 

[Free men’s classic t-shirt pattern](https://craftworld.com/cms/free-mens-classic-t-shirt-pattern-and-tutorial/)

The first shirt for my husband, and it immediately became one of his favorites. Sewn using the free pattern from @lovesewingmag Issue23. It’s sewn, like all T-shirts, fairly simply and quickly. The instruction is only 2 pages long and has pictures, so it’s easy to follow.

I liked the pattern. T-shirts are perfect for beginners, this T-shirt has an easy fit with no complex panels or darts to worry about. The neckline is finished with a jersey band, and you can choose to sew it either with a regular machine or an overlocker. It comes in sizes XS to XL. The markings are in the form of triangles, each labeled with the corresponding size to avoid confusion. The only thing to keep in mind is that the 1 cm seam allowances are already included.



So, I chose the M size and added an extra 2 cm in length to the shirt. The fabric is from @textile.contact.ua, and it’s a stretch jersey Penye with 90% cotton and 10% elastane. It’s 180 cm wide with a density of 180 and is made in Turkey.

I didn’t have black thread for the hem, so I cut 1-centimeter strips from white interfacing.

Step 1. Shoulders. I reinforced the shoulder seams with interfacing on the back side, and then they were ironed to the backside, and it wouldn’t be visible if you use contrasting interfacing like I did. I folded the two pieces of fabric, front and back, with right sides facing each other and stitched the shoulder seams.

Step 2. Neckline. I deviated slightly from the instructions by inserting the neckline into the already closed shoulders (as in the instruction for the T-shirt #vikisews_ala). I sewed the neckline to the collar. Then I inserted it and stitched it on the overlock machine.

The instructions don’t suggest closing the zipper tape seam, and I didn’t close it because the shirt was a trial version and quickly went into use.

Step 3. Sleeves. I sewed the sleeves to the armholes, aligning the notches, and then stitched them together.

Step 4. Side seams. I stitched the side seams with a single seam from the edge of the sleeve to the bottom of the shirt on the overlock machine.

Step 5. Hemming. I switched the overlock machine to a cover stitch, and to finish, I double-stitched the hem of the sleeves and the bottom of the shirt with a flat seam. And that’s it.

Overall, it’s a great free pattern. It’s easy and quick to sew, with clear instructions and illustrations. There are only five steps: shoulders > neckline > sleeves > side seams > hemming.
